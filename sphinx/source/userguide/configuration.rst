Configuring dr2xml
==================

To configure dr2xml, the user has to fill two Python dictionaries, one related to the model and the
laboratory choices and another related to the simulation to run.

If a parameter is found in both laboratory and model settings and simulation settings,
they are taken from simulation settings.

For a detailed descriptions and possible values for these attributes, see the WIP position paper
“CMIP6 Global Attributes, DRS, Filenames, Directory Structure, and CV’s”:
